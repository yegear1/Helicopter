# Helicopter 3D OpenGL

Hello!

This was a college project, in which I had to make a Helicopter in openGL legacy with the following features

• Propellers that start and stop moving by pressing the letter 'i' ( Couldn't turn off the propellers in the air )

• Moving forward, backward, up, down with just the propellers on and couldn't get past the ground

• It would have to have 2 missiles and 1 machine gun

• And have the textures of the ground and the helicopter

I spent something like 15-20 hours working on this project, with the help of a friend
